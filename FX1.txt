ZOMBIE BY THE CRAMBERRIES 

Another head hangs lowly, 
Child is slowly taken. 
And the violence caused such silence, 
Who are we mistaken? 
But you see, it's not me, 
it's not my family.
In your head, in your head they are fighting, 
With their tanks and their bombs, 
And their bombs and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are crying... 
In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, 
Hey, hey, hey. What's in your head, 
In your head,
